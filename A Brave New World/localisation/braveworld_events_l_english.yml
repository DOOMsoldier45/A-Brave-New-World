 britain.25.d:0 "Prime Minister Robert Gascoyne-Cecil has decided to step down from being the leader of the United Kingdom. He cites failing health and age as his reason for leaving office. The seventy-two year old has decided to spend what time he has left on this earth with his children. In his place, Arthur Balfour has taken his place until the next change of events."
 britain.25.a:0 "Hopefully we won't get any declarations..."
 britain.26.t:0 "Conservatives Lose Election!"
 britain.26.d:0 "The Conservative Party for the United Kingdom has lost to the Liberal Party following a division of the party's base over imperialism or decolonialization, taxes, Chinese labor, and a failure for a swift end to the effects of the Boer War.

 usa.26.a:0 "May he rest in peace."
 usa.27.t:0 "Election of 1904"
 usa.27.d:0 "The election of 1904 has come around. The Republican Party was shaken by the attack on President McKinley but has had several years to recover.

Therefore, the people demand proper action against a very aggressive force in Central America."
 usa.33.a:0 "Protect Panama!"
 usa.33.b:0 "Allow Panama and Columbia to sort it out themselves"
 usa.34.t:0 "Panama Canal Treaty"
 usa.34.d:0 "With the recent events between Panama and Columbia, and secret dealings between Panamanian and American diplomats several months before, Congress has finally drafted and approved the Panama Canal Treaty.

 usa.51.t:0 "Independence of Puerto Rico"
 usa.51.d:0 "Many have begun to question what Puerto Rico is. The territory was taken from the Spanish in the Spanish-American War. However, they are not citizens of the United States yet are considered incoprated as a territory of the United States.

 usa.52.t:0 "The Platt Amendment"
 usa.52.d:0 "With the end of the Spanish-American War, the fate of Cuba is in the United States' hands. The nation is struggling to adopt a constitution as the United States continuously rejects them while it creates something to integrate Cuba closer into the United States. Thus, the Platt Amendment was born. It transfers the territory of Guantanamo Bay to the United States and ties the Cuban economy closer to the American counterpart. Their currency is also directly pegged to the USD as opposed to gold or silver like other national currencies."
 usa.52.a:0 "Enforce the demands!"
 usa.53.t:0 "Cuban Freedom?"
 usa.53.d:0 "The United States has passed the Platt Amendment and elected to give the Cuban people freedom from military occupation. A new republic is born, but the Unites States still has great influence on our government."
