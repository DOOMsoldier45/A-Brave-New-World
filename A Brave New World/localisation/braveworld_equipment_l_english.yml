The initial response was to equip troops with cotton mouth pads for protection. Soon afterwards the British added a long cloth which was used to tie chemical-soaked mouth pads into place. Dr. Cluny MacPherson of Newfoundland Regiment brought the idea of a mask made of chemical absorbing fabric and which fitted over the entire head to England, and this was developed into the British Hypo helmet of June 1915. This primitive type of mask went through several stages of development before being superseded in 1916 by the canister gas mask. This had a mask connected to a tin can containing the absorbent materials by a hose."
