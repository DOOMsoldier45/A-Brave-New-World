 TURNOFCENTURY_NAME:0 "Turn of the Century"
 TURNOFCENTURY_DESC:0 "It is the beginning of the 20th century and the world is celebrating everything. On national matters, Britain and France remain the dominant imperial powers throughout the globe, the United States is celebrating its successes in surpassing the European quality of life, Germany is celebrating military victories over France, and Russia is beginning a rapid advancement to the modern industrial era. The world is abuzz with life but tensions are silently growing behind the scenes."
 FRA_TURNOFCENTURY_DESC:0 "France had issues with the Germans in the last decades of the 19th cenutry and has been having internal issues as of late. The wars with Germany have damaged France's internationl prestige and Communism is on the rise in the nation, a peak having been reached in 1871 with the short-lived Paris Commune. The French military is still powerful but is not poised to fight major military powers. While it is powerful, it is spread out thin in its overseas colonies. There is much to do if France wishes to keep its empire - and its people - safe from threats."
 USA_TURNOFCENTURY_DESC:0 "The United States now enjoys its growing economic power and influence. Its military, while small in comparison to other world players, is very well trained and extraordinarily well armed for what credit it was given in its early years. The nation has also emerged from what was considered one of the most powerful nations in Europe victoriously - Spain in the Spanish-American War.  While the United States remains \"anti-interventionalist\" with almost every nation outside its immediate concern, it is beginning to take a more active role in Latin American politics. The United States has a lot of potential for whichever path the People will."
 ENG_TURNOFCENTURY_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom remains strong and in tip-top shape as the Victorian era comes to a close, Her Majesty having reached her sixty-third year of ruling the British Empire. However, as time marched on, public support for the empire has been slowing diminishing - many international observes believing that the death of Queen Victoria will be the end of Pax Britannia. However, the nation continues to enjoy prosperity and growth in its overseas holdings and at home."
 GER_TURNOFCENTURY_DESC:0 "The German Empire is one of the youngest European nations, only slightly older than the new Italian nation which formed only thirteen years ago. Germany enjoys a time of increased economic potential, outstanding military success against older, more established powers (namely France), and is home to one of the most efficient economies in Europe that does not rely on an empire. However, this latter part comes with drawbacks as Germany relies on trade moreso than most European nations to get its resources to fund this economy. Who is to dictate Germany's future - the other Europeans or the Germans?"
 AHU_TURNOFCENTURY_DESC:0 "The Austro-Hungarian Empire is an empire in decline; a once great nation torn apart by the weakening of the central government and the old age of Emperor Franz Joseph. While the Emperor wishes to preserve the strained union between Austria and Hungary, doing so has damaged the fractured nation more. As a result of the rise of a new ideology, parts of the country are claiming to be a unique people not to have their fates determined by Austrians. A unique, partially independent government exists in Hungary, reinforcing their beliefs. As of now, Austria-Hungary faces two roads: crumble apart or tough out the consequences of tough choices."
 TUR_TURNOFCENTURY_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire is crumbling; their prestige having been destroyed by the successful rebellions in Greece (supported by the United Kingdom), Bulgaria, Serbia, and Bosnia-Herznegovina (all supported by the Russians). While the Ottomans remain in control of some of mainland Europe, the people's living under their rule do not look favorably upon their overlords. Unrest is brewing in the North, and the South is bordered by hostile Western governments - namely the United Kingdom. Italy and the United Kingdom have taken rightful Ottoman land in the Treaty of Berlin - Libya and Egypt respectfully. The Ottomans must reclaim their rightful empire!"
 SOV_TURNOFCENTURY_DESC:0 "European and American news agencies have described as a backwards nation due to its poor infrastructure, deporable education system, and more. The ruling Tsar has promised his people with improving their way of life economically and socially. The Russian government has been secretly preparing for a Pan-Slavic war; a unique concept that demands that all Slavic peoples unite under one mother nation The way forward for Russia is tricky as national dissent has been rising among the common people and those caught expressing these beliefs have pointed to either a democracy or pushing a new ideology created by Karl Marx called \"Communism.\""

 OTHER_TURNOFCENTURY_DESC:0 "While the smaller nations struggle against these larger, more aggressive powers, they will not sit idely by as their boundries and histories are written before them without their consent. These nations will take up different stances and some will be forced to confront nations of greater strength if they are to survive. Their destinies, to them, are theirs to forge and theirs to forge alone - even if it means paying the iron price."
